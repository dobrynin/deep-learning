  * Show as a linear classifier with odds ratio?

# Logistic Regression

* Talk about how logistic function turns odds ratios into probabilities.
* Talk about how then doing cross-entropy is effectively the same as
  minimizing negative log likelihood.
* Do a GD for the enron dataset.

# Bonus

* Accuracy of NB estimates.
