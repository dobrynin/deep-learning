I no longer talk about the odds ratio interpretation of the
coefficients. Do I want to put that back in?

I hint at but don't fully explain the problem with GD with the poorly
parameterized model.

Pretty sure I will leave XE interpretation to a bonus workbook. But I
think that is not complete.

Should probably show how NB estimates of probability are very poor.
