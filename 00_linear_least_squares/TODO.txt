* Just show them Gradient Descent to finish it off as quickly as
  possible.
* Also discuss why this is the maximum likelihood estimate.
* Put parameter estimation stuff as bonus?
* Break out as bonus material the simplicity of quadratic
  optimization. Discuss multidimensional problem when contours are
  skewed. Show then how you can't just do Newton's method on each
  dimension seperately.
* Put derivation of simple least squares formula as a bonus.
