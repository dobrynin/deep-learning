* Explain GD:
  * I already explain the gradient.
  * I talk about how we want to take small steps toward the minimum,
    going down each time.
  * Need to explain why gradient is direction to step in. Feels like I
    need to explain the dot product.
* Last: explain what is meant by maximum likelihood estimate.
  * Show derivation from negative log probabilities.
* BONUS:
  * General oarameter estimation discussion
  * Derivation of simple least squares formula, coefficient of
    correlation.
