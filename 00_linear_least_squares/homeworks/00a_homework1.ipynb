The first argument is the `x` values, the second the `y` values, and the third is how you want to render the points. Use `'.'` for now to graph the points. Just plot the `x`s against the same `x` values for now. You should get a straight line of dots.\n",
    "3. Next, calculate `y` by squaring all the `x`s and adding 5. You don't need loops. Plot the xs against the y values now. Again, use '.' to plot dots.\n",
    "4. Last, plot a curve through the `y` values. Use the `'-'` style to plot a curve.\n",
    "5. Notice the points are connected by line segments. Briefly change `x` to have an increment of 1.0 to see how janky the curve can look.\n",
    "6. Before each call to `plot`, add a line which says `plt.figure()`. This will create a new figure each time."
