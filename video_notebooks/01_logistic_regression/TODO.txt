**Part 1**

* Low reach features are inaccurate. Filter them.
* Conditional Independence
  * It isn't unconditional independence.
  * It isn't normally true.
* Calculating Recall vs false positive rate
* Negative features
* Training vs test sets
* Why does Naive Bayes generalize well?

**Part 2**

* Defining parameters
* Odds to probability
* Maximizing Likelihood
* Why NB isn't necessarily the best model
* Reparameterization to eliminate "absence" features.
* Rewriting error as XE error.
* Sigmoid
* Derivation of derivatives

**Part 3: Bonus**

* Entropy
* Generative vs Discriminative
* Graphical model
